# Why Use This Fork?

This build of Alacritty focuses on an improved macOS experience. Here’s what you gain compared with the upstream project:

- **Modern app icon**: the icon is built with macOS Tahoe in mind.
- **Wide‑gamut rendering**: the rendering targets Display P3, so colors stay vibrant on Apple displays.
- **Sharper fullscreen**: the terminal now reaches every edge of the screen with no padding, maximizing lines and columns.
- Every macOS build is **signed** and **notarized by Apple**. You can install it without bypassing Gatekeeper prompts or running `xattr` commands.
